It offered a checklist of potential features for the title, which included elements such as a prominent game title on the main screen, font style options, background changes based on themes, and localization support for multiple languages. User input prompted questions regarding the preferred positioning of the title and its visibility during gameplay. The user expressed a desire for a fully customizable font style, a theme-based title background, and localization support. The AI confirmed it would work on these features and later sought clarification on the user's preferred style and whether any specific characters from the game should be included in the title. The user provided additional feedback and the AI acknowledged messages about crafting a great title, asking for a description of the project to assist further. Overall, the exchange focused on identifying and developing customizable features for the game's title to enhance user experience.",
